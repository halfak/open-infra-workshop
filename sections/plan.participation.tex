Participants will be recruited through a mixture of strategies.  We will contact participants from past workshops\cite{wiggins14quality, morgan15advancing, goggins14ocdata}.  We'll post announcements on social media (Twitter \& Facebook) as well as open science/HCI related listserves.  Participants will be selected based on their interest and experience working on OOC datasets.  We will be inclusive since we'd like to learn about opportunities to support a wide variety of research experience levels and expertise, but we will cap attendance at 50 participants because group coordination would likely become difficult after this point.

As we accept participants to the workshop, we'll survey them to gather ideas for replication/extension studies that could be mostly completed in the context of a workshop day.  Participants will be asked to suggest a study to replicate/extend and describe what datasets and analysis would be necessary.
