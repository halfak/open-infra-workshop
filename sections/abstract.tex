We propose a full day workshop focused on
experimentation with documentation protocols and
technologies that are designed to make the process
of ``breaking into'' a new dataset more tractible for 
researchers studying open online communities.
This workshop's purpose is to bring together researchers
to test these systems and discover problems and missed
opportunities to support iteration.  Participants
will also be given the opportunity to use state-of-the-art
documentation and technologies to break into a new collection
of datasets.  This workshop is the direct result of a call
to action to build shared infrastructure for data sharing
between researchers from past CSCW workshops and related
conferences.
