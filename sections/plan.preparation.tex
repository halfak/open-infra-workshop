We'll gather and describe a small set of primary datasets relevant to the replication/extension studies we plan to ask participants to run.  We'll supplement the methods descriptions of the paper we have chosen to replicate based on our proposed methods protocol.  As part of this work, we'll also perform our own replication in advance to know what time-intensive analyses are involved.  We'll take the opportunity to produce secondary datasets that would take too long to reproduce in the course of an 8 hour workshop day.

Datasets will be preloaded in our shared querying environment (Quarry) and metadata will be described in the OCDF metadata census wiki.  Both of these systems work as intended today, but we'll be continuing to extend them and add features as the workshop approaches.
