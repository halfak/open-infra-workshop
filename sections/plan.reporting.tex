At the end of the day, we will use the last hour as an opportunity for our participants to discuss what worked and what didn't.  We will capture their discussion points in a collaborative document that all participants will be invited to edit and extend.  We'll use these notes and our observations during the workshop to publish a report summarizing major take-aways to inform future work.
