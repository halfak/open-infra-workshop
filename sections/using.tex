Regretfully, the technical availability of OOC datasets has not been a panacea for the study of socio-technical phenomena in these communities.  Based on past research and workshops designed to help us explore OOC data science practices, we have identified three key hypotheses about what makes \emph{breaking into} new datasets so difficult: (1) methods descriptions are often insufficient as a guide to replication \& extension, (2) technological literacy bars access to processing large datasets, and (3) inconsistent and poorly indexed metadata prevent discovering what data is available and what the items of a dataset \emph{mean}.
